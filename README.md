A new theme designed for the open web: Responsive out-of-the-box, colourful, extendable and featuring latest web-technologies.

Its aim: Transforming the power of Friendica into an adaptable UI making it more easier for (new) users to do their first steps in the federated socialverse. On the long-term(!) this theme will offer a workflow which combines many features & modules.

*Features:*
Support for Ionicons and ShaShape-Icon's by Andi Stadler (Implemented)
Support for new styles (In progress)
Compose stream-entries inside a modal-window (In progress)
View album's / pictures inside a modal-window (In progress)
Native Chat integrated into the leftbar
AJAX-featured search (aka autosuggest)
New UI-concepts for albums, profiles, the homepage,...
...

*Please notice:* Currently this is not more than a prototype which already displays static content, but has no dynamic functionality. Help (especially regarding the JS-migration) is kindly appreciated.
